# Summary

ls is used to list all the files in a directory  
For a short file, it's the quickest way to read the contents.  
More precisely, it concatenates one or more inputs to standard output.  

# Basics
`ls`  
List the files and directories inside the current directory  
Hidden files (the name begins with '.') will not be included.  

`ls ~`  
List the files and directories inside the home directory. Again, this excludes hidden files.  

`ls -a ~`  
This time, include the hidden files.  

`ls -al ~`  
The -l parameter presents the output in a long listing format.  
It shows permissions, user/group, size and the date the file was last modified
