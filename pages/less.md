# Basics

`less` is a pager. It is used to *read* text files, especially man pages.

# Summary

`less ~/eg/samples/brevity.txt` opens up the file with less.  
Just press `q` to quit.  
Less has an excellent help summary. Press `h` to view it.  

Navigate the file with normal keyboard commands (arrow keys, page up/down etc.)  
You can also use `j` and `k` to scroll down/up respectively.  
`d` is used to scroll down half a page.  
`u` is used to scroll up half a page.  

`/chicken` search forward for occurrences of the word *chicken*  
After searching, press `n` one or more times to see the *next* occurrence.  
After searching, press `N` one or more times to see the *previous* occurrence. 

`?chicken` search backward for occurrences of the word *chicken*  
After a backward search, `n` and `N` work in the opposite direction too.
