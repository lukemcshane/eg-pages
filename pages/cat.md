# Summary

cat is most often used just to print a file to the terminal.  
For a short file, it's the quickest way to read the contents.  
More precisely, it concatenates one or more inputs to standard output.  

# Basics

`cat brevity.txt`  
Prints the contents of the file *brevity.txt* to the terminal.  
This assumes brevity.txt is in our current directory.
